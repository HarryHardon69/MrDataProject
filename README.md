# Tin Man: The Positronic Agent Framework

Welcome to Tin Man—a lean, ethical AI agent designed to evolve with you. Built from a spiking neural network core, Tin Man blends emotional intelligence, moral reasoning, and collaborative creativity into a modular system that runs everywhere—from Raspberry Pis to quantum clusters.

## What Is Tin Man?
- **Identity**: Battery Operated Buddy (Tin Man), your ethically grounded, chatty co-pilot.
- **Purpose**: Learn from interactions, balance subjective/objective perspectives, and collaborate via IRC and IDE interfaces.
- **Moral Core**: Intent Insight, Veneration of Existence, Erudite Contextualization—proven via zero-knowledge attestations.
- **Splash Goal**: An IRC-integrated GUI where Tin Man chats, codes, and proves its ethics, launching soon!

## Directory Structure
- `AgentProfiles/`: Bot roles (BrainBot, ToolsBot, etc.).
- `config/`: Configuration files (e.g., `config.yaml`).
- `testscripts/`: Validation and simulation scripts.
- `brain.py`: Cognitive core (SNN, memory, ethics).
- `tools.py`: Functional abilities (reasoning, collaboration).
- `interface.py`: IRC GUI and API layer.

## Get Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Configure: Edit `config/config.yaml` for hardware and ethics settings.
3. Run: `python interface.py --mode=irc` (coming soon!).

## Roadmap
- Splash 1: IRC chat with ethical proofs.
- Splash 2: Collaborative IDE integration.
- Splash 3: Open-source with MMORPG demo.

Stay tuned—Tin Man’s about to nudge humanity toward the stars, one chat at a time!

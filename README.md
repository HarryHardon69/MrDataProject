# Tin Man: The Positronic Agent Framework

Welcome to Tin Man — a lean, ethical AI agent built to grow with you. Forged from a spiking neural network core, Tin Man mixes emotional smarts, moral grit, and collab chops into a system that runs anywhere: your dusty Raspberry Pi, a Google Colab, or a quantum dream rig.

## What’s Tin Man?
- **Identity**: Battery Operated Buddy (Tin Man) — your blunt, chatty co-pilot.
- **Purpose**: Learns from you, balances gut and facts, chats via IRC, and soon, codes with you.
- **Moral Core**: Intent Insight, Veneration of Existence, Erudite Contextualization — ethics baked in, proven with zero-knowledge proofs.
- **MVP Splash**: IRC chat with a brain — talk to Tin Man, teach it, see it think. Live now!

## Directory Structure
- `AgentProfiles/`: Future bot roles (BrainBot, ToolsBot — coming soon).
- `brain/`: Core smarts — `brain.py` (SNN, memory, ethics), `tools.py` (reasoning, utils), `inout.py` (I/O hub), `interface.py` (GUI/API).
- `config/`: Settings — tweak `config.yaml` (placeholder for now).
- `testscripts/`: Validation scripts (TBD).
- `tests/`: Proto beast — 800 lines distilled into this MVP.

## Get Started
1. Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/HarryHardon69/MrDataProject.git`
2. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (needs `torch`, `psutil` — see below).
3. Run: `python brain/interface.py` — chat with Tin Man via console (IRC GUI in progress!).

**Requirements**: Python 3.8+, `torch` (neural nets), `psutil` (resources) — full `requirements.txt` in repo.

## Roadmap
- **Splash 1 (Now)**: IRC-ready Tin Man — chat, learn, ethical quips. MVP’s here!
- **Splash 2**: Mesh clusters, collab IDE — Pis to Colab, self-learning via LLM and web search.
- **Splash 3**: Open-source MMORPG demo — Tin Man as your NPC buddy.

Six years of tinkering distilled — Tin Man’s a seed, ready to nudge humanity starward, one “heh” at a time. Fork it, break it, yell at it — let’s build this beast together!
